SOFTENG 281 - Graph Calculator 

Developed a graph calculator that determined various graph properties such as reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity through the terminal.

Represented graphs using object-orientated concepts and implemented search operations such as Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search iteratively and recursively.

Implemented a double-linked-list data structure with consideration of its time complexity.
